# DiUI
A basic UI framework for use in Oblivion Remaster modding.
I'm attempting to build things in an OOP Lua sort of way, so most things are generated with constructors and interacted with by directly calling their methods. I'm also attempting to use valid annotations for everything, which should make it easy to work with in VS Code or another IDE with Lua annotation support.

Examples:
